# SafeSpot üõ°Ô∏è

**AR-powered emergency safety guidance that saves lives**

SafeSpot uses your phone's camera to instantly identify safe zones and dangers during disasters. Point, scan, survive.

## What It Does

- **Real-time AR detection** of objects using RoomPlan API
- **Color-coded safety guidance**: Green = safe, Red = danger
- **Clear instructions** overlaid on real objects ("GET UNDER", "STAY AWAY")
- **Works offline** - critical when networks fail during emergencies
- **Supports multiple hazards**: Earthquake, fire, flood, tornado

## How It Works

1. Select your emergency type (earthquake, fire, etc.)
2. Point your phone around the room
3. Follow the AR guidance to safety

During an earthquake, SafeSpot might highlight a sturdy table with "GET UNDER" or warn about a bookshelf with "STAY AWAY."
